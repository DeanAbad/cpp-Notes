# cpp-Introductory-Reviewer
A repo containing introductory reviewers for C++ programming language.
Each cpp file contains strings as notes and examples related to its subject, therefore by simply running it, the reviewer is present.

#### Update:
- [ ] Provide proper order via adding numerical prefixes.
- [x] Use comments as notes in raw and move string notes to function i.e. notes().
  - [x] ~~Prevent obfuscation by separating the string notes and examples to another function.~~
