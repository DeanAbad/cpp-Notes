# cpp-Introductory-Reviewer
A repo containing introductory reviewers for C++ programming language.
Each cpp file contains strings as notes and examples related to its subject, therefore by simply running it, the reviewer is present.

#### Update:
- [x] Prevent obfuscation by separating the string notes and examples to another function.
